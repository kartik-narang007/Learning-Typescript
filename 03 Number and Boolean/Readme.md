# Number and Boolean

Now we have already covered String there are two primitive types left to cover are - 
    a.  number
    b.  boolean

## Number
    let userId : number = 3334455 // when we put "." against it, 
    it will show all the methods related to the number.
  Now it doesn't matter if i put a decimal behind it .
